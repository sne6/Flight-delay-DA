# Flight Delay Data Analytics

This project explores and analyzes U.S. flight delay data using Python. It involves data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in flight delays.

## **Datasets**

* `flights.csv` — Flight-level records with delay info
* `airlines.csv` — Airline code → airline name
* `airports.csv` — Airport code → airport details

## **Technologies Used**

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Data merging, cleaning, EDA

##  **Key Steps**

✅ Cleaned data by removing cancelled/diverted flights, handling missing values, and filtering outliers

✅ Merged datasets for enriched flight records (airline names, airport info)

✅ Visualized:

* Arrival delay distribution
* Average delay by airline, month, origin airport
* Correlation matrix of arrival delay, departure delay, air time, and distance


## **Future Work**

* Build delay prediction models
* Create interactive dashboards (Streamlit / Plotly)
